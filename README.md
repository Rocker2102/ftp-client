# FTP Client
Web app to browse ftp sites with a better UI/UX.

Made using <b>PHP7</b> and <b>Materialize.css v.1.0</b> &copy; CSS3 framework.<br>
<i>A HTTPS connection should be used to prevent password leakage while transferring sensitive links (downloading files).</i>

<h4>Notice: </h4>
<i>This web app <b>does not</b> create a <b>persistent connection</b> to the FTP server. A new connection (<b>new login/session</b>) is created before every operation (Unless you are viewing a cached or local copy of the results).</i>
